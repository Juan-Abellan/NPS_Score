# Olist's Net Promoter Score (NPS) ðŸ”¥

The **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** of a service answers the following question:

> How likely is it that you would recommend our company/product/service to a friend or colleague?

For a service rated between 1 and 5 stars, like Olist, we can **classify customers into three categories** based on their answers:
- âœ… **Promoters**: customers who answered  with a score of 5
- ðŸ˜´ **Passive**: customers who answered with a score of 4 
- ðŸ˜¡ **Detractors**: customers who answered with a score between 1 and 3 (inclusive)

<br>

ðŸ‘‰ NPS is computed by subtracting the percentage of customers who are **detractors** from the percentage of customers who are **promoters**.

> NPS  
= % Promoters - % Detractors   
= (# Promoter - # Detractors) / # Reviews  
= (# 5 stars - # <4 stars) / # Reviews
